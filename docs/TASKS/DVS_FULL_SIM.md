# Task: Full DVS Simulation with Hough Space

**Status:** Implemented — testing remaining  
**Goal:** Add Hough space to the full simulation, simulating a full DVS camera pipeline, and support real DAVIS346 hardware.

---

## Current State

### What Exists

1. **Three vision paths** (selected in `system_builder.build_vision` via `params.hardware.dvs_cam` and ports):
   - **`SimVisionModel`** (default): Direct projection of true state → `CameraPair`. Adds noise and optional delay. No events, no DVS.
   - **`SimEventCameraInterface`**: Simulates DVS by generating events from true state, feeding them to a line algorithm, returning `CameraPair`. Uses `PaperHoughLineAlgorithm`.
   - **`RealEventCameraInterface`**: Real DAVIS346 cameras via dv-processing. Background threads read events, Hough runs continuously. `get_observation(None)` returns latest estimate. Used when both `dvs_cam_x_port` and `dvs_cam_y_port` are set.

2. **`SimEventCameraInterface`** (`perception/vision.py`):
   - `generate_events(b, s, n=200)`: Samples points along the line in pixel space, adds noise, filters to in-frame.
   - `get_observation(state_true)`: Projects state → true line → generates events → Hough → `CameraPair`.

3. **`RealEventCameraInterface`** (`perception/vision.py`):
   - Uses `DVSReader` to open two DAVIS346 cameras by serial.
   - Background threads: read events → `algo.update()` → store latest pixel-space `CameraObservation`.
   - `get_observation(state_true)`: Ignores state, returns latest `CameraPair` (pixel→normalized).

4. **`DVSReader`** (`perception/dvs_camera_reader.py`):
   - Wraps dv-processing. Opens camera by serial, `get_event_batch()`, `close()`.

5. **`PaperHoughLineAlgorithm`** (`perception/dvs_algorithms.py`):
   - Refactored to follow the original Java recursive event update more closely.
   - Uses Java-style Hough tuneables (`mixing_factor`, `inlier_stddev_px`, `min_determinant`) instead of the old batch-level decay model.
   - Returns `CameraObservation` or `(None, None)`.

6. **Unified runner** (`simulation/simulation_runner.py`):
   - When `dvs_cams_connected(params)`: `real_mode=True`, Simulator skips `plant.step()`, returns `state_est`. Hardware-in-the-loop ready.

7. **Standalone benchmarks**:
   - `benchmarks/benchmark_hough.py`: Static / falling pencil / mixing sweep, with optional event chunking to better mimic packetized camera delivery.
   - `benchmarks/visualize_dvs_cams.py`: Init both cams, render events + Hough line overlay. Use before HIL.

## Remaining: Testing

Most implementation is complete. Remaining work:

1. **Optional**: Run `benchmark_single` with real cams to quantify stability.

---

## Future directions (optional)

1. **Explicit Hough space**: Replace or augment the quadratic accumulators with an explicit Hough parameter space (e.g. θ–ρ bins), per the paper’s "Gaussian in Hough space" description.

2. **More realistic event simulation**: Improve `SimEventCameraInterface.generate_events()`:
   - Temporal structure (event timestamps, rate)
   - More realistic event distribution (e.g. brightness change threshold)
   - Possibly integrate with plant dynamics for motion blur / event density

3. **Benchmark DVS in full sim**: Run `benchmark_single` and `benchmark_all_configs` with `dvs_cam=True` to compare DVS vs direct projection (noise, delay, stability).

4. **Unify Hough benchmark with full sim**: Ensure `benchmark_hough.py` and `SimEventCameraInterface` share the same event-generation logic and that the full sim uses the same DVS pipeline.

---

## How to Enable DVS

**Simulated DVS** (no hardware): In `main.py`, set `dvs_cam=True`, leave ports `None`. Uses `SimEventCameraInterface`.

**Real DAVIS346**: Set `dvs_cam=True`, `dvs_cam_x_port=None`, `dvs_cam_y_port=None`. Uses `RealEventCameraInterface`; runner enters real mode (skips plant). cams automatically grab the serial port

## Hough Tracker Refactor Note

The original Python Hough tracker was later found to be behaviorally different from the Java `PencilBalancer` implementation used as the reference.

The important realization was:

- the old Python code applied a fixed once-per-batch decay
- the old Python code gave every event equal weight
- the original Java code updated recursively per event using a Gaussian inlier weight and adaptive forgetting

That mismatch is now documented in:

- `docs/TASKS/HOUGH_PROGRESS.md`

The code has been refactored to match the Java update rule more closely, but **real-hardware validation is still pending**, so this section should be treated as progress notes rather than a final performance claim.

## Latency: Real-Time Hybrid Sim vs Original sam_cam.py

**Symptom:** When running real-time hybrid sim with real DVS cameras (`dvs_algo="sam"`), the pencil/line overlay has noticeable latency compared to the standalone `sam_cam.py` script.

### Pipeline Comparison

| Component | Original sam_cam.py | Project (main.py + SAM) |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Event source | `getNextEventBatch()` | Same, via `DVSReader` |
| Noise filter | `BackgroundActivityNoiseFilter` 30 ms | Same when `dvs_algo="sam"` |
| Line fit | OLS on filtered batch | `SamLineAlgorithm` (equivalent) |
| Downstream | Direct display | Reconstruct → Estimator → Controller → Display |

### Identified Latency Sources

1. **BackgroundActivityNoiseFilter (30 ms)** — Both use it. Events must persist for 30 ms before output. This is the largest single source of latency.

2. **visualize_dvs_cams vs main.py** — Use `--noise-filter-duration 30` to match main.py. Without it, standalone viz has no filter and feels more responsive.

3. **Estimator phase lag** — `LowPassFiniteDifferenceEstimator` (alpha=0.9) smooths velocities and adds phase lag. The workspace shows the controller command `(x_des, y_des)`, which depends on this estimate.

4. **Event batching** — `getNextEventBatch()` may buffer events; timing depends on dv-processing.

### Recommended Fixes — Implemented

1. **Configurable noise filter duration** — `HardwareParams.dvs_noise_filter_duration_ms`: `None` = no filter; `> 0` = duration (ms). Set to 5–10 for low-latency, or `None` to disable. Sam only; Hough never uses the filter.

2. **Align visualize_dvs_cams with main.py** — Use `--noise-filter-duration 30` to match main.py. Omit for no filter (more responsive but incomparable).

3. **Configurable estimator alpha** — `RunParams.estimator_lpf_alpha`: `None` = LPF default (0.95); set to 0.99 for lower phase lag in real-time.

4. **Surface-based regression** — Already using per-batch OLS (`SamLineAlgorithm`); no change needed.
